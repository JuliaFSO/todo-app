    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>I'm Julia, a full-stack developer dedicated to constantly improve my skills. I'm currently enrolled
    in a React + Redux course, where I learned how to build this to-do app. With this course, I am focusing on
    enhancing my React skills and expanding my knowledge of the framework. My goal is to become an expert in the
    field and to be able to build high-quality, efficient and powerful web applications. My passion for coding and
    my determination to learn new things makes me a valuable asset to any team.</p>
